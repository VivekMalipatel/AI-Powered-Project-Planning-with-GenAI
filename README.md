# AI-Powered Project Planning with GenAI

## Project Overview

This repository contains the final project for the **Software Project Management (CS587)** course, focusing on AI-powered project planning using GenAI technologies, frameworks, and libraries. The project explores traditional **Waterfall** and agile **Scrum** methodologies to design comprehensive project plans for a software application. The selected domain for this project is **Healthcare**, specifically developing an AI-powered computer vision system that detects skin anomalies such as cancer or psoriasis.

## Project Scope and Objectives

The project is divided into two phases:

1. **Phase 1 - Waterfall Methodology**:
   - Create a project plan based on a traditional, sequential development model.
   - Cover the five phases: **Requirements, Analysis/Design, Implementation, Testing, and Documentation**.
   - Utilize GenAI tools to automate task planning, time estimation, and documentation generation.

2. **Phase 2 - Scrum Methodology**:
   - Develop a project plan using iterative, agile workflows.
   - Define **Scrum roles** (e.g., Developers, Scrum Master, QA Engineers).
   - Perform sprint planning, backlog grooming, and iteration reviews using GenAI technologies.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Automation**: Leverage GenAI platforms and libraries to simulate conversations between project stakeholders (e.g., Customer Agent, Project Manager Agent).
- **Phased Development Plans**:
  - **Waterfall**: Sequential planning for a robust, detailed execution framework.
  - **Scrum**: Flexible, iterative planning to accommodate dynamic changes.
- **Experimental Analysis**:
  - Evaluate the accuracy and coherence of GenAI-generated outputs.
  - Analyze productivity metrics and task breakdown for each role in the project.
- **Presentation Deliverables**:
  - Detailed **Phase 1** and **Phase 2** presentations (PPT).
  - Recorded live demonstrations of results.

This project demonstrates the potential of GenAI technologies in modern project management, blending traditional and agile methodologies with AI-powered automation and analysis.
